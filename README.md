# SwiftUI-animations-objects-templates
 Collection of SwiftUI objects and animations templates üë®‚Äçüíª

This repository aims to provide a collection of SwiftUI templates that allow you to create various objects and animations in your iOS, iPadOS, or MacOS applications. You can use them however you like, and I will be adding some animations from time to time. If you wish, you can also enhance certain code snippets to make them visually more appealing or more descriptive. It's under the MIT license, so you're free to use this repository as you see fit. Enjoy and may the code be with you ü§ô
Currently, there is only one picker view available that allows selecting reactions or even responding through comments. However, I will keep this repository up to date based on the experiments I conduct from time to time with SwiftUI. Feel free to subscribe to stay updated with the latest news and regularly follow the latest additions to this repository.
